Bitcoin Cash,BCH,BCH/USD,8/1/2017,"Bitcoin Cash was started by bitcoin miners and developers equally concerned with the future of the cryptocurrency and its ability to scale effectively. BCH has its own blockchain and specifications, including one very important distinction from bitcoin.  BCH has implemented an increased block size of 8 MB to accelerate the verification process, with an adjustable level of difficulty to ensure the chain’s survival and transaction verification speed, regardless of the number of miners supporting it.",blockchain
Bitcoin,BTC,BTCUSD,1/9/2009,"There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. Bitcoin is limited by transaction processing time, an issue which has caused rifts between factions within the bitcoin mining and developing communities.",blockchain
EOSIO,EOS,EOS/USD,1/31/2018,"EOS is the native cryptocurrency for the EOS.IO blockchain platform with smart contract capabilities. It enables decentralized apps, or dapps, to be created by software developers. The platform is more scalable than many other blockchain networks, with the ability to process one million transactions per second without any fees. Its dapp development capability makes EOS similar to Ethereum with the notable distinction that transaction confirmations are done through a different type of consensus system. Block producers are chosen by the EOS ecosystem through a voting mechanism known as delegated-proof-of-stake (DPoS). In order to vote, users must stake tokens for three days without selling them, putting them at risk of losing money should the price of the token drop during that time. There is no maximum supply limit of EOS tokens. The delegated proof-of-stake model uses inflation, capped at 5% annually, to fund transactions and pay block users.",Dawn 3.0.1-alpha
Ethereum Classic,ETC,ETC/USD,7/30/2015,"Ethereum Classic emerged as a split version of the Ethereum's Blockchain, the other being Ethereum itself. The split occurred following a hack on Ethereum in June 2016, where $50 million worth of funds were stolen. The biggest issues with ETC is that it isn’t backward compatible with the ETH Hard Fork, and that many big players of the Ethereum community are now using ETH. Since ETC isn’t backward compatible with the Hard Fork, users of ETC won’t be able to enjoy the updates being built on ETH, such as Ethereum’s move from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake.",EVM 61 bytecode
Ethereum,ETH,ETHUSD,7/30/2015,"Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Development was funded by a crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014 and the system went live on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins premined. The biggest issues with ETH is that now that the hard fork seal has been broken, many are speculative that there could be more hard forks in the future. ",EVM 1 Bytecode
Chainlink,LINK,LINK/USD,6/1/2019,"Chainlink is a tokenized oracle network that provides price and events data collected from on-chain and real-world sources. Launched in 2017 by Sergey Nazarov, Chainlink aims to offer a solution to the “oracle problem,” or the ability to get the off-chain data needed to operate many blockchain-based smart contracts. The token incentivizes participants to provide and use this data. Chainlink does not operate its own blockchain. Instead, the token protocol is blockchain agnostic and can run on many different blockchains simultaneously.",Chainlink protocol
Litecoin,LTC,LTCUSD,10/7/2011,"Litecoin is a cryptocurrency launched in late 2011 by former Google and Coinbase engineer Charlie Lee. To create Litecoin, Lee copied the Bitcoin codebase, increased the total supply, and changed the speed at which new blocks are added to the blockchain. Only approximately 84 million litecoins will ever be created, quadruple the total bitcoin supply. Litecoin also creates new blocks every 2.5 minutes, four times faster than Bitcoin. The Litecoin investor and developer communities view the protocol as a complementary pseudo-testnet for Bitcoin and a “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s “digital gold”. The Litecoin foundation stewards the Litecoin project and finances Litecoin Core development.",MIT/X11 license
Augur,REP,REP/USD,7/28/2020,Augur’s Reputation token (REP) is an Ethereum token designed for reporting and disputing the outcome of events on online prediction markets. Reporters are rewarded for reporting the outcome of events correctly.,Ethereum blockchain
Stellar ,XLM,XLM/USD,7/31/2014,"Lumen (XLM) is the native cryptocurrency for Stellar, an open source blockchain payment system. The purpose of Stellar is to connect financial institutions via the blockchain and provide cheap transactions in developing markets. Jed McCaleb, a longtime cryptocurrency entrepreneur who founded bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and co-founded blockchain-based payment system Ripple Labs, created Stellar in July of 2014. Stellar uses a federated byzantine agreement (FBA) algorithm instead of a traditional mining network to validate transactions. Since the transfer of lumens doesn’t require approval from traditional cryptocurrency miners, the Stellar network enables quicker transactions than some other blockchain-based systems.",Apache License 2.0
Ripple,XRP,XRP/USD,5/15/2018,XRP is known as a Real Time Gross Settlement System which is a ‘currency exchange and remittance network’ that independent servers validate. The currency traded is known as XRP and transfer times are immediate. XRP can be exchanged for most other currencies with its unique selling proposition being the avoidance of fees and wait times often associated with banks. It isn’t made up of a blockchain but rather a Hash Tree and its currency can’t be mined because there are a finite number of coins – 100 billion. XRP is popular with banks and institutions though the XRP token isn’t necessarily required for each transaction.,isc license
